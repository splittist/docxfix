Work in the current repo. Use these files as your source of truth:

- The project outline file ./docs/project-outline.md
- The Phase 1 PRD file in ./docs/phase-1-prd.md
- PROGRESS.txt

1. Find the highest-priority item to work on and work only on that item.
   This should be the one YOU decide has the highest priority - not necessarily the first in the list.
2. Implement comprehensive tests.
3. Check that the tests pass.
4. Update the PRD file with the work that was done.
5. Append your progress to PROGRESS.txt.
   Use this to leave a note for the next person working in the codebase.
6. Make a git commit of that item.

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE ITEM.

If, while implementing the feature, you notice the PRD is complete, create a file PRD_1_COMPLETE.txt.
